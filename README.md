## What Is It?

A marketplace for sharing free items available for curb-side collection.

CurbTreasure was born of a real need to get rid of household items before moving.
So you don't have enough room in the moving van, or you consider the item(s) to be redundant, useless, junk.
Well, one person's trash is another person's treasure. CurbTreasure: browse free items availble to collect or post a picture with a location of your potential 'treasure' and people come to collect it from the curb.
